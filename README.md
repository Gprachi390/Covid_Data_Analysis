# Covid_Data_Analysis
Visualization of Covid-19 data 

The visualization and analysis is mainly done using Plotly library alongside showing the comparisons from matplotlib and Pandas plots.

The analysis is carried out using the numerical, graphical and interactive maps. 

Plotly: plotly.py enables Python users to create beautiful interactive web-based visualizations that can be displayed in Jupyter notebooks, saved to standalone HTML files, or served as part of pure Python-built web applications using Dash.
